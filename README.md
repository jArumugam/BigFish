Hello!

### Context
I came across many projects that study NYC Taxi Data.
Those studies predict taxi-ride demands based on features like location and weather. 
I want to add a new dimension. 

### Objective
Here, I intend to use network analysis tools to study the data. 

### Motivation
There is an immediate advantage for doing so. 
Previous studies predict pickup amount, trip fare, etc., in real-time. 
However, this information as such would need further processing for making decisions. 

### Actionable questions
The questions I address are the following:
- Given taxi-ride demand predictions, can we suggest optimal pick-up locations for a taxi driver? 
I want to consider a dynamic situation where the suggestion machine accounts for competition (or supply) from other taxi drivers.
