Hello!

### Context
I found many interesting projects that study NYC Taxi Data.
Most of them predict taxi-ride demands based on features like location and weather. 

### Objective
I want to add a new dimension. 

### Scope
I intend to use network analysis tools to study the data. 

### Motivation
There is an immediate advantage for using network analysis tools. 
Previous studies predict pickup amount, trip fare, etc., in real-time. 
However, this information as such would need further processing for making decisions. 
Network analysis offers rich models to answer many actionable questions. 
Further, network abstraction allows the solution to be useful in a wide range of other applications

### Actionable questions
The question(s) I address are the following:
- Given taxi-ride demand predictions, can we suggest optimal pick-up locations for a taxi driver? 
I want to consider a dynamic situation where the suggestion machine accounts for competition (or supply) from other taxi drivers. 

### Plan
1. Abstract data using networks 
2. Formulate appropriate optimization problems 
3. Get taxi-demand prediction working 
4. Visualize results 
5. Scale up 
6. Real-time app using cloud services 

### You are welcome!
Interested data scientists whoc are willing share specific resposibilities are welcome to participate. 

## Thank you for your time!
