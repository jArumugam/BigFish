## Effect of Discretization 

Apparently, central park is better visible with a finer discretization.

However, dependence of other structures in the data on discretization is not that apparent. 

## Network Abstraction of Pickup Locations 

Here the pickup locations are abstracted as a graph. A weighted graph reveals structure differently.

The weighted graph was formed based on number of trips between nodes.
