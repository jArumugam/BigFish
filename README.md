### Context
I found many interesting projects that study NYC Taxi Data.
Most of them predict taxi-ride demands based on features like location and weather. 

### Objective
I want to add a new dimension. 

### Scope
I intend to use network analysis tools to study the data. 

### Motivation
There is an immediate advantage for using network analysis tools. 
Previous studies predict pickup amount, trip fare, etc., in real-time. 
However, this information as such would need further processing for making decisions. 
Network analysis offers rich models to answer many actionable questions. 
Further, network abstraction allows the solution to be useful in a wide range of other applications

### Actionable questions
The question(s) I address are the following:
1. **_Given taxi-ride demand predictions, can we suggest optimal pick-up locations for a taxi driver?_** 
  - I want to consider a dynamic situation where the suggestion machine accounts for competition (or supply) from other taxi drivers. 

2. **_Are there good pickup-drop cycles?_** 
  - This is optimizing over longer periods of time isntead of looking at a particular instance 

### Plan
1. Abstract data using networks 
2. Formulate appropriate optimization problems 
3. Visualize results
4. Get taxi-demand prediction working 
5. Refine questions. Significant improvements to steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 
6. Scale up 
7. Real-time app using cloud services
